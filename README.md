# Indian Food Data Analysis and Visualization


##  Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization of an Indian food dataset. The dataset provides information on various Indian dishes, including their ingredients, dietary classifications, preparation and cooking times, flavor profiles, and regional details. The analysis uses Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to explore and visualize the data.

##  Dataset
The dataset indian_food.csv includes the following columns:

**name:** Name of the dish.  

**ingredients:** List of ingredients used in the dish.  

**diet:** Dietary classification (e.g., vegetarian).  

**prep_time:** Preparation time in minutes.  

**cook_time:** Cooking time in minutes.  

**flavor_profile:** Flavor profile of the dish (e.g., sweet).  

**course:** Course of the dish (e.g., dessert).  

**state:** State in India where the dish originates.  

**region:** Region in India where the dish originates.

##  Project Components
### Data Loading and Preparation:

Load the dataset from Google Drive.
Clean the data by handling missing values and incorrect entries.
###  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze frequency distributions of categorical variables like diet, flavor_profile, course, state, and region.
Explore the distribution and statistics of prep_time and cook_time.
Investigate unique values in categorical columns.
###  Data Visualization:

Pie Chart: Distribution of different diets.  

Bar Charts:
Top 10 dishes with the shortest cooking times.  

Top 5 dishes with the longest preparation and cooking times.  

Histograms: Distribution of preparation and cooking times.  

Cross-Tabulation Bar Plot: Relationship between diet types and flavor profiles.  

Word Cloud: Visualization of the most common ingredients.
## Results
Diet Distribution: Pie chart showing the proportion of different dietary classifications.  

Cooking Time: Bar chart displaying the top 10 dishes with the shortest cooking times.  

Preparation and Cooking Times: Bar charts for the top 5 dishes with the longest preparation and cooking times.  

Time Distributions: Histograms illustrating the distribution of preparation and cooking times.  

Diet and Flavor Profile: Bar plot depicting the distribution of flavor profiles across different diets.  

Ingredients Word Cloud: Visual representation of the most common ingredients used in the dataset.
## Notes
This project is designed to be run in Google Colab for interactive data analysis.   

Data cleaning steps, such as handling missing values and replacing placeholder values, are included to ensure data quality.
